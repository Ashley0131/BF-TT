This GitHub repository contains the truth tables of specific Boolean functions with 8 to 13 variables.

There are a total of 50 binary truth table files in `.txt` format. Each filename follows the format: “NumberOfVariables-Nonlinearity-Balanced0/Resilient1-TransparencyOrder”.
For example, “8-110-0-0.908824” represents an 8-variable balanced Boolean function with nonlinearity 110 and a transparency order of 0.908824;
“8-116-1-0.940196” represents an 8-variable 1-resilient Boolean function with nonlinearity 116 and a transparency order of 0.940196.
